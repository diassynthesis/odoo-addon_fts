==============

Provides an extensible framework for OpenERP to do full text search (using PostgreSQL's full text search mechanism) 
on different models. It aims at least possible administration effort while still providing fast and high 
quality search results for users. The modular design enables administrators 
to offer just the full text search wanted and developers an easy way to add searches. 
For a quick (somewhat technical) overview, read the presentation held on the Open Days 2013:
